# x1011nascase
This will become a repo for my effort to create a case for the x1011 and raspberry pi nas solution

This is my very first effort at creating a 3d model. 

It's based entirely on mechanical drawings for the x1011 and available STL files of the pi5. 

So don't expect it to be functional without further tinkering. 

I don't have a 3d printer. I don't have the actual hardware yet  

So, if anyone wants to try this that has the hardware. Any changes and comments will be welcomed  

Stefan..
